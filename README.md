# SyrDataSuppression
This is a repository containing a lot of the code I used during the summer of '22 @ Syracuse University. It might be a bit inconsistent at one or two places or not immediately clear (some of these are a bit ad-hoc). data_tools_syr3 is the main library I coded up with relevant suppression and data handling tools included in there. Updated versions of the data handling tools can be found in some of the .py files.

If any clarifications are required or if there are any questions or suggestions, email dsaswat@syr.edu about them.
